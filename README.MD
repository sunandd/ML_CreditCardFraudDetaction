## Introduction

The Default Next Month Payment Prediction Machine Learning Project aims to predict whether a credit cardholder is likely to default on their payment in the following month. The project uses historical credit card data and applies the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for prediction. Additionally, the data has been standardized to ensure that features are on the same scale, and fine-tuning has been performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the model's hyperparameters.

## Project Overview

Credit default is a significant concern for lenders as it can lead to financial losses. Accurate prediction of default risk allows financial institutions to make informed decisions, such as offering credit limit adjustments or guiding customers towards better financial management.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw credit card data for modeling. The data has been standardized to ensure consistent scales for each feature.

2. Feature engineering: Selecting relevant features and creating new meaningful features to improve the model's predictive performance.

3. Model training: Building and training the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm on the preprocessed data. The algorithm is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling continuous features.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of parameters for optimal performance.

5. Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes model using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

6. Deployment: Creating a user-friendly interface or integrating the model into existing credit risk assessment systems for real-time predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical credit cardholder data, including information on their payment behavior, demographics, and credit card usage. The dataset includes a binary target variable, indicating whether a cardholder defaulted on their payment in the following month.



## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Flask (if deploying the model with a web interface)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the requirements.txt using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib flask
   ```

3. (Optional) If you want to use GPU support for Scikit-learn, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex
   ```

## Usage

To use the pre-trained model or retrain the model on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your credit cardholder dataset in CSV format, ensuring it has features similar to the sample dataset.

2. Place your dataset file in the appropriate directory.

3. Run the `training_pipeline.py` script to train the model:

   ```bash
   python training_pipeline.py
   ```

4. After training, the model will be saved to disk for future use.

## Model Training

The `training_pipeline.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. Loads the credit cardholder dataset.

2. Preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.

3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.

4. Initializes and trains the Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the training set.

5. Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best model configuration.

6. Evaluates the tuned model on the testing set.

7. Saves the tuned model for future use.

## Evaluation

The performance of the tuned Gaussian Naive Bayes model is assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy.

## Deployment

To deploy the default next month payment prediction model, you can either:

1. Integrate the tuned Gaussian Naive Bayes model into your existing credit risk assessment systems.

2. Develop a web interface using Flask or any other web framework to allow real-time predictions.
